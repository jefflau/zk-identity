# zk-identity: proof of darkforest winner

This app allows a user who was a winner in one of the first 4 rounds of the [dark forest game](https://zkga.me/) to prove that they were without revealing their identity.

It uses zk-SNARKs to make proofs whose legitimacy is verified on Ethereum.

The project is part of [0xPARC's winter 2021 Applied ZK learning group](https://0xparc.org/blog/program-for-applied-research).
